# News Articles Title Generation Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the News Articles Title Generation Challenge hosted by Ecole Polytechnique and Kaggle. The goal of this challenge is to develop advanced natural language processing models to automatically generate compelling and informative titles for news articles in the `French language`, enhancing reader engagement and information retrieval in todayâ€™s fast-paced digital age.

## Dataset

The challenge involves working with a dataset of French language news articles in the `French language`. The dataset is split into three files:

- `train.csv`: Contains 30,659 news articles and titles.
- `validation.csv`: Contains 1,500 news articles and titles.
- `test_text.csv`: Contains 1,500 news articles for which titles need to be generated.

## Installation

To get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required Python libraries

## Usage

To run the title generation models:

1. Navigate to the `src` directory.
2. Execute the main script

## Evaluation

The models will be evaluated using the ROUGE-L F-Score metric, focusing on the proportion of n-gram overlap between system-generated sentences and reference sentences.
